# Dope_Papers_Summaries
*Summaries and highlights of insightful papers in AI.*

There are tons of cool papers out there. Yet, more often than not, academic papers are filled with redundacies and fancy terms/equations that are not always neccessary and increase the friction of understanding the main contribution of the work. Also for me, it is quite difficult to maintain the best ideas out of the paper in my memory for longer than a few seconds after I hit that close button and move on with my life.
