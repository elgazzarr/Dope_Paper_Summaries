# Dope_Papers_Summaries
Summaries and highlights of insightful papers in AI. 


There are tons of cool papers out there. Yet, more often than not, academic papers are filled with redundacies and fancy terms/equations that are not always neccessary and increase the friction of understanding the main contribution of the work. Also for me, it is quite difficult to maintain the best ideas out of the paper in my memory for longer than a few seconds after I hit that close button and move on with my life. 
The goal of this repo is to find the minmal viable product (MVP) of cool inovative work in AI and neuroscience, package it in a concise format,  along with my opinon and document it here.

My objective is to read and summarize 1 paper/day.
